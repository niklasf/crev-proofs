  autocfg is a small and simple crate to be used in build scripts.
  
  Code snippets are passed to rustc to detect if the available version supports
  the desired features and can compile them. For completeness, it should be
  mentioned that it would be a bad idea to use this with user inputs at
  runtime. It is hard to do so accidantely.

  num-traits provides traits for writing code generic over numeric types
  and implementations for built-in numeric types. I exclusively reviewed
  unsafe code.
  
  num-traits uses some instances of unsafe code. Each unsafe block has a
  comment explaining why it is required and why it is sound. The blocks are
  easy to understand and check locally.

  Unsound API due to a missing !Send bound, allowing data races in safe code.
  Mitigated by the fact that most common uses will not expose this
  vulnerability, but it is unacceptable for a crate whose entire purpose is to
  provide safe synchronization primtives.
