  This small crate implements Windows-style and Unix-style shell escaping.
  Its not clear which exactly are the supported shells, so its hard
  to guarantee the escaping is safe for all possible ones (although it
  looks fine for all common shells).
  
  A second worry is the runtime detection of the current shell, where an
  environment variabe (MSYSTEM) can be used to change the escaping style to
  Unix. For users of the crate, if the environment is known, I would recommend
  explicitly specifying it, instead of relying on the detection.
  
  The exposed functions have the signature Cow<str> -> Cow<str>. It would seem
  that &str -> Cow<str> is more natural.
  
  I do not know if character encodings play a role, here, and if str is the
  correct type to be working with.

  A high quality crate that is now used by the standard library. Some use cases
  for using it directly remain, such as no_std support, and low level APIs for
  building other datastructures.
